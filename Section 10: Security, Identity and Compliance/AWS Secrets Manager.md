It supports **automated secret rotation** using **Lambda functions**, integrates natively with services like **Amazon RDS**, and encrypts secrets using **AWS KMS**. Unlike SSM Parameter Store, Secrets Manager focuses on secret lifecycle management, rotation, and replication. You can also replicate secrets **across AWS regions** for high availability and disaster recovery scenarios.
