# üóÇÔ∏è Amazon S3 Lifecycle Rules ‚Äì AWS MLE Exam Notes

## ‚úÖ What Are Lifecycle Rules?
Used to **automate transitions** between S3 storage classes or **expire/delete** objects to save costs.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Key Features

- **Transition**: Move objects to cheaper storage (e.g., S3 Standard ‚û°Ô∏è IA ‚û°Ô∏è Glacier)
- **Expiration**: Auto-delete objects after a set time
- **Noncurrent Version Expiration**: Delete older versions of versioned objects
- **Abort Incomplete Multipart Uploads**: Saves cost from unfinished uploads

## üß† Rule Triggers

- Based on **object age in days**
- Can apply filters:
  - **Prefix** (e.g., `logs/`)
  - **Tag-based** (e.g., `env=archive`)

## üõë Exam Tips

- Lifecycle rules work **only on new objects** from when the rule is added.
- Must have **versioning enabled** for noncurrent version actions.
- Lifecycle rules help with **cost optimisation** (a big exam theme).
- Use **filters** to scope rules to specific objects.
