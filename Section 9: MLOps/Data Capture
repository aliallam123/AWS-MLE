# SageMaker Model Monitor – Data Capture

## 🧠 What Is Data Capture?

- A feature of **SageMaker Model Monitor**.
- Captures:
  - **Input data** sent to inference endpoints.
  - **Output predictions** returned by the model.
- Stored as **JSON** in **Amazon S3**.

## 🔄 Key Use Cases

- **Debugging** and analysis of inference behavior.
- **Monitoring** prediction stability over time.
- **Retraining** models using real-world inference data.
- **Detecting drift** by comparing to a baseline.

## ⚙️ Features

- Works with both:
  - **Real-time inference**
  - **Batch transform jobs**
- Supported through:
  - **SageMaker Python SDK**
  - **Boto3 (Python)**
- Supports **encryption** of logged data.
- Data can trigger **alerts** when it deviates from a baseline.

## ✅ Exam Essentials

- Logs **both inputs and outputs** to inference endpoints.
- Output format is **JSON**, stored in **S3**.
- Can be used for **monitoring, retraining, or auditing**.
- Fully supports **encryption** for data security.
- Works in **real-time** and **batch** settings.

## 🎯 Quick Tips

- Mention of “capturing endpoint activity” → **Data Capture**.
- Want to retrain from live traffic? → Use captured inference data.
- JSON logs → S3 → secured + used in drift monitoring.
